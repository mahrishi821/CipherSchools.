create two branch along with master branch
master 
dev-1
dev-2

then we were taught the concept of merging if we to merge dev-1 to master then we will go to master and write the command
git merge dev-1

and then we will add dev-2 
to master
git merge dev-2


now then  we have merged the dev- 1 and dev-2 branch to master  branch
then update the dev-1 seprately and dev-2 seprately
then while merging it into the master we will get conflict
            conflict can be solved by adjusting the code 
delete the branch
delete branch -d  dev-1
