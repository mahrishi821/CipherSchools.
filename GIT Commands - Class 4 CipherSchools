//checkout --safe command || donot change history
//revert --
git revert  commit_number 
//The git revert command is used for undoing changes to a repository's commit history
// to abort the command we can use
 git  abort --revert
// checkout didnot allow us to make changes but revert allow us to make changes

//reset command

it reset to specific in which want to go and the further commit will be deleted 
if we do normaly reset it will ask an d give us chance to to think
 but if we use
git reset -- hard commit_number
it will not give me a chance to think
            commit 1      commit 2        commit3 
master ----*-----------------*-----------------*-----------------

//branch
git branch dev-1 // it will create a new branch
git branch // it will show us all the branch

git checkout dev-1 // it will go to dev-1 branch

// shortcut to make a branch and  go a branch is 
git checkout -b dev-2
 here -b means creating a new branch
