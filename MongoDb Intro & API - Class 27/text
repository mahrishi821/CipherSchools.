//MONGO DB
What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (known as BSON, Binary JSON). This differs from traditional relational databases that store data in tables with a predefined schema.

Key Features of MongoDB:
Schemaless Design: MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, allowing for flexible document structures within a collection.

High Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, distributing data across multiple servers, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

Rich Query Language: MongoDB's query language supports complex queries, indexing, and aggregation operations to manipulate and retrieve data efficiently.
